## My process

### Built with

I learned how to make my css centered. 

#mainContainer {
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%;
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
  width: 300px; 
  height: 485px; 
  background-color: white;
  padding: 16px;
  border-radius: 10px;
  box-shadow: 0 0 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
}

I have nothing to thank you here. It's does not mean I didn't have anyone to help me with this project but I was just doing it by my own and I don't have anyone available to help me at this moment. I was also trying my best to do this my own.
